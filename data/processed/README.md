## Methodological information

1.  Description of methods used for collection/generation of data: 
A survey was conducted to gather information on the respondents demographics and current recycling behavior, then four different measures were proposed and the respondents were asked to rate each measure on a Likert scale from 1 to 5. They were asked to rate the option "Education campaign" before and after reading the education content to determine whether their knowledge would influence this result. Their previous knowledge was also tested by letting them rate the significance of various consequences of improper battery recycling on a Likert scale.

2.  Methods for processing the data: 
    The responses were cleaned by renaming columns, removing nonsensicaldatapoints and pivoting where necessary. 

3.  Instrument- or software-specific information needed to interpret the
    data: none

4.  Standards and calibration information, if appropriate: none

5.  Environmental/experimental conditions: 
    The survey was distributed over social media and reached people in and around the city of Zürich. Everyone is from inside the canton.

6.  Describe any quality-assurance procedures performed on the data: If all ratings are the same the survey was probably not done seriousely and the data was excluded.
