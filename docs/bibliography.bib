Inadequate environmental health (EH) conditions and work systems contribute to HAIs in countries like Malawi. We collected qualitative data from 48 semi-structured interviews with healthcare workers (HCWs) from 45 healthcare facilities (HCFs) across Malawi and conducted a thematic analysis. The facilitators of infection prevention and control (IPC) practices in HCFs included disinfection practices, patient education, and waste management procedures. HCWs reported barriers such as lack of IPC training, bottlenecks in maintenance and repair, hand hygiene infrastructure, water provision, and personal protective equipment. This is one of the most comprehensive assessments to date of IPC practices and environmental conditions in Malawian HCFs in relation to HCWs. A comprehensive understanding of barriers and facilitators to IPC practices will help decision-makers craft better interventions and policies to support HCWs to protect themselves and their patients.},

  abstract = {Background Modern energy enables health service delivery. Access to electricity is, however, unreliable in many health facilities in developing countries. Little research has explored the relationships between energy and service delivery. Methods Based on extensive literature searches and iterative discussions within the research team, we first develop a conceptual framework of the role of energy in health facilities. We then use this framework to explore how characteristics of electricity supply affect distinct energy uses in health facilities (e.g. lighting), and how functional or non-functional lighting affects the provision of night-time care services in Malawi. To do so we apply descriptive statistics and conduct logistic and multinomial regressions using data from the Service Provision Assessment (SPA) of the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) for all health facilities in Malawi in 2013/2014. Results The conceptual framework depicts the pathways from different energy types and their characteristics, through to distinct energy uses in health facilities (e.g. medical devices) and health-relevant service outputs (e.g. safe medical equipment). These outputs can improve outcomes for patients (e.g. infection control), facilities (e.g. efficiency) and staff (e.g. working conditions) at facilities level and, ultimately, contribute to better population health outcomes. Our exploratory analysis suggests that energy uses were less likely to be functional in facilities with lower-quality electricity supply. Descriptive statistics revealed a critical lack of functional lighting in facilities offering child delivery and night-time care; surprisingly, the provision of night-time care was not associated with whether facilities had functional lighting. Overall, the DHS SPA dataset is not well-suited for assessing the relationships depicted within the framework. Conclusion The framework conceptualizes the role of energy in health facilities in a comprehensive manner. Over time, it should be empirically validated through a combination of different research approaches, including tracking of indicators, detailed energy audits, qualitative and intervention studies.},

This assessment explores the status and consequences of energy access through interviews and surveys with administrators and healthcare workers from 44 HCFs (central hospitals, district hospitals, health centres and health posts) in Malawi. Most HCFs are connected to the electrical grid but experience weekly power interruptions averaging 10 h; less than one-third of facilities have a functional back-up source. Inadequate energy availability is associated with irregular water supply and poor medical equipment sterilization; it adversely affects provider safety and contributes to poor lighting and working conditions. Some challenges, such as poor availability and maintenance of back-up energy sources, disproportionately affect smaller HCFs. Policymakers, health system actors and third-party organizations seeking to improve energy access and quality of care in Malawi and similar settings should address these challenges in a way that prioritizes the specific needs of different facility types.},

  abstract = {Background: Access to electricity is critical to health care delivery and to the overarching goal of universal health coverage. Data on electricity access in health care facilities are rarely collected and have never been reported systematically in a multi-country study. We conducted a systematic review of available national data on electricity access in health care facilities in sub-Saharan Africa. Methods: We identified publicly-available data from nationally representative facility surveys through a systematic review of articles in PubMed, as well as through websites of development agencies, ministries of health, and national statistics bureaus. To be included in our analysis, data sets had to be collected in or after 2000, be nationally representative of a sub-Saharan African country, cover both public and private health facilities, and include a clear definition of electricity access. Results: We identified 13 health facility surveys from 11 sub-Saharan African countries that met our inclusion criteria. On average, 26\% of health facilities in the surveyed countries reported no access to electricity. Only 28\% of health care facilities, on average, had reliable electricity among the 8 countries reporting data. Among 9 countries, an average of 7\% of facilities relied solely on a generator. Electricity access in health care facilities increased by 1.5\% annually in Kenya between 2004 and 2010, and by 4\% annually in Rwanda between 2001 and 2007. Conclusions: Energy access for health care facilities in sub-Saharan African countries varies considerably. An urgent need exists to improve the geographic coverage, quality, and frequency of data collection on energy access in health care facilities. Standardized tools should be used to collect data on all sources of power and supply reliability. The United Nations Secretary-General's ``Sustainable Energy for All'' initiative provides an opportunity to comprehensively monitor energy access in health care facilities. Such evidence about electricity needs and gaps would optimize use of limited resources, which can help to strengthen health systems.},

A cross sectional survey was conducted to collect data from 351 farm households (171 biogas adopters and 180 non-adopters) in the province of Yogyakarta. This study employed treatment effects analysis based on propensity score matching techniques to evaluate the impacts of biogas technology adoption among the farm households. The results showed that the adoption of the biogas technology reduces firewood consumption of smallholder farm households in Indonesia. Unfortunately, the impact on the use of slurry for organic fertilizers and the use of gas (Liquid Petroleum Gas, LPG) as another household cooking energy could not be evaluated. This study empirically showed that the benefits of the biogas technology had not yet been optimized at the household level which may partly explain the slow rate of biogas technology diffusion among farmers. However, the consumption reduction of firewood as a benefit of using biogas contributed to behavioral changes of the women in the households especially with respect to firewood collection and cooking activities.},

There is also a consensus that ensuring universal access to modern energy in an energy deficit country will also help improve living standards of people in line with national and global goals. Through a 2018 National Energy Policy, Malawi effectively domesticated the Sustainable Development Goal Seven and the Sustainable Energy for All objectives which among others seek to ensure universal access to modern energy by the year 2030. However, now in the last decade of the 2030 agenda, the country is not yet on the path to achieving the universal access to energy goal despite of having numerous opportunities for reversing the energy poverty trends. Doing a post-mortem is of essence in order to determine prospects and constraints to achievement of the national energy goals and objectives regarding universal access to modern energy. Therefore, this paper seeks to discuss the status of energy access to modern energy in the country, the prospects and constraints in relation to energy policy, regulatory environment, institutional capacity, energy resource, capital investment, technology and human resource.},

  abstract = {The inaccessibility of modern energy in low-income countries (LIC), especially in the Sub-Saharan African (SSA) region, continues to be a problem in the 21st century. The lack of access to modern energy has led to an inability to implement developmental structures and initiatives. While considerable progress and successes have been realised in the last three decades with increased activities and global commitments from international governments and multinational agencies through electrification projects in the SSA region, SSA countries remain off-track in their efforts to achieve the UN Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 7. This is mainly demonstrated in sparsely populated rural regions where the high cost of centralised power generation, poor transmission and distribution infrastructures and economic factors have been a major barrier to electricity expansion. Although the use of RES (i.e., decentralised or stand-alone systems) have been acknowledged by the International Energy Agency (IEA) to be the least expensive route to improving access, its impact has not been effectively demonstrated regionally. Decentralised RES use in SSA countries have not seen significant uptake and/or enjoyed long-term sustainability owing to a number of factors. Malawi, despite its significant hydropower resources and the favourable proximity of its inhabitants to grid infrastructures, still has one of the lowest levels of access to electricity globally, with 86\% of the population having no access to electricity. The country provides a good case study to investigate factors limiting electricity access in SSA countries. This paper explores the main issues that have historically hindered the uptake and sustainable operation of decentralised RES in the country. Recommendations to facilitate a potential improvement in RES use as a pathway to improved universal energy access are then put forward.},

The yield and the composition of biogas from the different substrates were evaluated and the cumulative curves were estimated. Two experimental campaigns were carried out, the first on three mixtures (chicken, pig and bovine manures), the second on animal and vegetal biomasses (chicken and cow manure, olive husk) with different inocula (rumen fluid and digested sludge). In the first campaign pig manure mixture showed the maximum biogas production (0.35 Nm3/kg) and energy content (1.35 kWh/kg VS); in the second one the differences in produced biogas from the different inocula were analyzed: olive husk with piggery manure anaerobically digested as inoculum showed the higher biogas (0.28 Nm3/kg VS) and methane yield (0.11 Nm3/kg VS), corresponding to an energetic content of 1.07 kWh/kg VS. All data obtained from the laboratory scale anaerobic digester are comparable to the values in literature for several biomass and in particular for olive husk, dairy manure and chicken manure.},

Four scenarios were taken into account considering two small-scale farms located in different areas: two (previous) scenarios where manure was stored in a manure pit and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) was used for cooking; and two (current) scenarios where manure is treated in low-cost digesters, the digestate replaces the synthetic fertiliser and the biogas is used for cooking replacing the LPG. Results showed that digesters implementation considerably reduced (by up to 80\%) potential environmental impacts associated with manure handling, fuel and fertiliser use in the small-scale Colombian farms. This was mainly due to the reduction of LPG and synthetic fertiliser use which were replaced by biogas and digestate. An economic assessment showed that low-cost digesters reduced expenses associated with cooking fuel and fertiliser purchase by 80\%.},

Over the past two decades, immense amounts of money have been spent by African governments, private individuals, and most conspicuously, international aid agencies and donors, on countless biogas projects in every country on the continent. Yet, despite the investments, biogas in African countries has not taken off, and the continent is strewn with the ruins of hundreds of failed and abandoned biogas projects. Moreover, scholarly literature contains little feedback about what actually happens on the ground. Drawing on this critical reading of the literature, including its blindspots on project outcomes and failures, and drawing on the authors' own extensive experience with small-scale biogas projects in Malawi and South Africa, this comment article calls for more scholarly critical reflection on why a biogas revolution, that has been perennially over the horizon, has yet to arrive while centring the role of social scientists to engage with biogas owners and operators to bridge the socio-technical divide from potential to practice.},

  abstract = {Abstract             A significant proportion of South African municipalities, who hold the mandate for providing solid waste management (SWM) services for millions of South Africans, appear to be on the brink of collapse. On the frontlines of municipal failure, the city of Makhanda, following two decades of poor governance and mismanagement, has found itself unable to fulfil its mandate, with the state retreating on SWM service provision, and disruptions to waste management services becoming a daily reality. Drawing on embedded, qualitative fieldwork, this article examines how differently placed residents have experienced disruptions to SWM services. This work explores how residents of Makhanda's two halves: the affluent and predominantly white neighbourhoods in the west, and the poor, non-white townships in the east, have (or have not) adapted to manage and dispose of their own waste during periods of disruption. Findings suggest that disruptions to waste management service provision have been broadly experienced by residents. However, the consequences of interruptions to municipal collection have not been evenly borne, as more resourced, western residents have been more successful at managing their own waste disposal, while the residents of Makhanda's townships are less capable of coping, with affected communities coming to resemble a dumping ground, and residents having to adopt unsafe or environmentally harmful disposal practices. These findings are important because they shed light on the challenges of creating cleaner, more equal communities without healthy municipal participation in waste management services, while raising important considerations for a South Africa facing the possibility of widespread municipal collapse.},

  abstract = {With the world's oceans in crisis, citizen knowledge and awareness around riverine and marine waste has become an increasingly crucial topic of study. For most investigations, spatial analysis has centered on the coastline, or most specifically the beach, i.e., the space where most respondents (urban, Northern, middle class), encounter marine litter. Yet, by focusing on               the beach               as the primary space of analysis, most studies have severely limited the scope of citizens they can engage, because in many African cities it is a space of exclusion. Moreover, for individuals further upstream, in spaces distant from the coast, what are their understandings of riverine and marine litter? What is their knowledge of the hydrological systems standing between them and the sea, and how do they see their ability to influence them? Drawing on extensive qualitative fieldwork in low-income, riverine adjacent communities in Durban, South Africa, and Blantyre, Malawi, the purpose of this article is to understand how Africa's urban poor experience and understand riverine and marine litter. The study utilises Foucault's notion of problematisations, and more recent adaptations of Foucault's work toward waste as a lens to conceptualise processes of problem formation: how individual respondents view riverine and marine litter as a               problem               . Findings suggest that problematisations around waste, in the community and in the hydrological system, are formed through daily experience and personal hardship; in the case of Blantyre, through the perceived impact waste can have on hydroelectricity generation, and in Johanna Road, by its contribution to flooding within the community. However, understandings of the marine environment and respondents' impact on the hydrological system, remain limited. Recommendations include rooting education and messaging around riverine and marine litter within low-income individuals' lived realities. However, any interventions targeted towards the poor               must               be accompanied by broader systemic change: improving access to solid waste management services and creating cleaner and more equitable communities.},

Despite the large number of existing small scale anaerobic digesters and a growing interest in food waste digestion, there has been a paucity of research regarding low cost digester's performance. This paper aims to provide a snap shot of the performances of small scale digesters treating food waste exclusively. The performance of six small scale digesters, ranging from 1m3 to 25m3 were recorded and analysed. Results showed consistently high substrate degradation ranging from 92.5\% to 97.5\% COD with daily methane production ranging between 0.25m3/kg VS and 0.46m3/kg VS. Composition of biogas analyzed yielded between 63.1\%--66.8\% CH4 and between 27.4\%--33.3\% CO2. Results also revealed a negative linear correlation between gas production and \% total solids and a positive linear correlation between gas production and the organic loading rate. While small scale digesters can effectively degrade food waste; the total dependency on digester for their gas requirements is unlikely and alternative fuel source is required.},

The principal factors controlling its dissemination include: policies and institutions, financial constraint, subsidies, availability of inputs, awareness about the technology, consumers' considerations, and success stories about the technology. However, biogas technology is a multipurpose technology which assists in addressing economic, health, social and environmental problems simultaneously. Thus, development and dissemination of the technology certainly minimize energy poverty and improve peoples' status in the energy ladder. In line with this, Ethiopia has completed implementing the first phase (2009--2013) of its National Biogas Programme and has started implementing its second phase. During the first phase, it was able to disseminate 57.6\% the total 14,000 domestic biogas plants planned for the period. Though the technology was introduced about five decades ago into the country, biogas installations constructed prior to the establishment of the National Biogas Programme were having varied digester models, lacked standards and central coordination and their entire number was not more than 1000. This paper reviews the status of dissemination of household biogas technology, factors influencing the dissemination of the technology, benefits of the technology at global scales, energy resources, consumption patterns and brief account of the technology at national scale-Ethiopia.},

  abstract = {Ultrasound sonography (USS) is an essential diagnostic tool with growing relevance in resource-limited health systems. This study examines the association between electricity supply and USS availability and functionality in Malawi\&amp;rsquo;s public and non-public health facilities. Using data from the 2018/2019 Harmonized Health Facility Assessment (HHFA), we conducted a cross-sectional analysis of 596 facilities. Electricity supply was categorized into stable grid, unstable grid, and non-grid. Adjusted prevalence ratios (PR) were estimated using robust Poisson regression. Only 9.9\% of facilities had USS available, and of these, 93\% had functional equipment. Compared to stable grid facilities, those using non-grid electricity were 85\% less likely to have ultrasound available (PR: 0.15, 95\% CI: 0.02\&amp;ndash;0.50) and 86\% less likely to have it functional (PR: 0.14, 95\% CI: 0.02\&amp;ndash;0.49). Diagnostic access was also considerably lower in primary-level and government-owned facilities. Spatial mapping revealed that most facilities without USS were primary-level and powered by non-grid or unstable grid sources. While electricity is necessary, it is not sufficient to ensure diagnostic readiness. Findings highlight the need for integrated planning across the energy and health sectors, present an opportunity for stronger government-CHAM collaboration, and support the targeted deployment of handheld ultrasound in energy-constrained settings.},

Using the example of Switzerland, it analyses the presence and perseverance of colonial structures and power relations in a country that has never been regarded as or understood itself as an official colonial power. In a first step, we compare present debates on colonialism in Switzerland with those in neighbouring countries, i.e. France, Germany, Italy and Austria. In a second step, we trace previous research that postulates a link between Switzerland and colonialism, and apply the concept of `colonialism without colonies', which, in contrast, engages with methods and themes that have emerged from postcolonial studies. Finally, we present a specific case study on `Swiss commodity racism' in order to elucidate the concept `colonialism without colonies'.},

  abstract = {Methane (CH4) is emitted during extraction, processing, and transport processes in the natural gas industry. As a powerful greenhouse gas, CH4 releases are harmful to the environment. Operators aim to minimize methane loss, and continuous monitoring using low-cost fence-line sensors are now being developed to observe methane enhancements downwind of operations. However, it is not clear how useful these systems are and whether they can be used to quantify emissions or simply identify the presence of a leak. To investigate this, we deployed 4 calibrated low-cost sensors 30 m from emissions of known rates over a 48-h period. The aims were to determine: (1) how much of the time a fence-line system would detect a leakage event from a single, point source of the size typically seen at oil and gas production well pads and (2) how accurately a fence-line system can estimate CH4 emissions using a relatively simple downwind dispersion method. Our results show that during a 48-h measurement period, the fence-line sensor network could detect CH4 releases of 84 g h--1 40\% of the time and 100\% of the time for emissions greater than 167 g h--1 using an enhancement threshold of 2 ppm. A Gaussian plume inversion based on binned centerline, maximum measured concentrations and the WindTrax Lagrangian particle model were each tested. With these models, average estimated emissions were within {\textpm}50\% of a known emission rate in 24 h and {\textpm}25\% in 48 h; however, estimated individual 20-min average emissions vary by more than a factor of 10. A simple Gaussian plume inversion using all of the measured concentrations produced unreasonable average emission estimates because of the inability of the equation to parameterize lateral dispersion at distances less than 100 m when the sensor was on the edge of the plume. This study provides evidence to support the use of low-cost sensors as autonomous fence-line monitoring systems to detect and potentially quantify emissions. If the sensors are properly calibrated and sensor deployment location is optimized for prevailing wind directions at each site, fence-line systems could be used routinely to quantify emissions from oil and gas infrastructure.},

  abstract = {In areas with limited access to electricity or during power outages, ensuring continuous and reliable use of grid-powered electrical instruments is challenging, especially in remote emergency centers. A stable source of electricity is crucial to prevent disruptions in power supply, as they can lead to severe medical complications, jeopardize patient well-being, and even result in fatal incidents. To address this issue, integrating renewable electricity sources such as off-grid solar systems into existing power supply infrastructure can be a viable solution. Recent studies suggest that off-grid solar systems can be reliable and sustainable options for powering medical facilities, particularly in areas lacking uninterrupted grid connectivity. Therefore, this research aims to evaluate the feasibility, benefits, and challenges of integrating off-grid power to support critical medical instruments. Based on an extensive literature review, interviews with experts, and surveys among relevant users, this study finds that the system has the capability to maintain a consistent, dependable power supply, even during adverse weather conditions. Cost and feasibility are highlighted as paramount considerations, based on surveys and focus group results. The study concludes that off-grid solar systems offer an economical, low-maintenance, and environmentally sustainable alternative for remote medical facilities. Finally, this study proposes recommendations to optimize critical device performance during power outages and improve overall system functionality and efficiency.},

One key infrastructure gap is access to reliable electricity, absence of which can significantly affect the quantity and quality of healthcare services being delivered at rural primary health facilities. However, absence of granular empirical evidence is a barrier for quantitatively understanding the significance of electricity access as one of the determinants of access to reliable primary healthcare. Using data from India's District Level Household and Facility Survey, we develop zero-inflated negative binomial models with co-variates and state-level fixed effects to estimate the relationship between levels of electricity access and the quantity of basic health services delivered at Primary Health Centers (PHCs). We find that lack of electricity access is associated with a significant and large decrease in the number of deliveries (64 percent), number of in-patients (39 percent), and number of out-patients (38 percent). We further find that lower level of electricity access at primary health centers is disproportionately associated with adverse effects on women's access to safe and quality healthcare.},

Here we describe OpenHumidistat: a free and open-source humidistat for laboratory-scale humidity control that is affordable ({\texteuro}500) and easy to build. The design is based around mixing a humid and dry air flow in varying proportions, using proportional solenoid valves and flow sensors to control flow rates. The mixed flow is led into a measurement chamber, which contains a humidity sensor to provide feedback to the controller, to achieve closed-loop humidity control.},
